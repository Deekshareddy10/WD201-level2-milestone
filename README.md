# WD201-level2-milestone
Task:
1)Create a new registration.html page in your application that you created in the previous lesson. You need to use the same registration.html page created in WD101 course as a part of Capstone.
2)Create a new route /registration in the application that serves the registration page created in the previous step.
3)Add a new link in the project.html page under Projects List that points to the new registration page. Ensure that you can now navigate from the projects page to the registration page using the link.
4)Add a new command line argument to the application named port and use the supplied port number while creating the server in index.js. For example, running node index.js --port=5000 should spin up a server that listens to port 5000.
5)Push the contents of the project to a new public repository and submit the same from the Submissions tab. The files must be present in the root of the repository and not inside any folder.
